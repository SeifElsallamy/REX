# REX
A chrome extension to capture live regex patterns from JavaScript URLs and the current page.

This tool is mainly intended to help bug bounty hunters, penetration testers, and security professionals capture interesting data from a page, such as API keys or endpoints, in places that are difficult to reach and may require authentication.

Thanks to ChatGPT; I almost did not code anything at all.
